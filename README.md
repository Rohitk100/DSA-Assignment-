Q1. Stack Using Array
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. In this question, a stack is implemented using an array without using any built-in stack library.

Operations
PUSH() - Adds an element to the top of the stack.
POP() - Removes the top element from the stack.
PEEK() - Displays the top element without removing it.
DISPLAY() - Displays all elements of the stack.
Overflow and Underflow
Stack Overflow occurs when we try to insert an element into a full stack.

Stack Underflow occurs when we try to remove an element from an empty stack.

Complexity
PUSH: O(1)
POP: O(1)
PEEK: O(1)
DISPLAY: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Q2. Circular Queue Using Array
A circular queue is a linear data structure in which the last position is connected back to the first position. It follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

In this question, a circular queue is implemented using an array.

Operations
ENQUEUE() - Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
DEQUEUE() - Removes an element from the front of the queue.
FRONT() - Displays the front element.
DISPLAY() - Displays all elements of the queue.
Full and Empty Queue
The queue is full when there is no available position for a new element.

The queue is empty when there are no elements in the queue.

Circular Queue vs Linear Queue
A circular queue makes better use of available memory because the unused positions at the beginning can be reused.

In a linear queue, when the rear reaches the last position, unused spaces at the beginning may remain unavailable.


Complexity

ENQUEUE: O(1)
DEQUEUE: O(1)
FRONT: O(1)
DISPLAY: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
